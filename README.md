# Jlaja – Simplify Your Travel, Amplify Your Fun

**Jlaja** is an innovative mobile app designed to redefine how you plan and experience your travels. As university students, this is our very first app, and we poured our creativity, passion, and ambition into creating something original and impactful. Built using **Kotlin** and **Java** in **Android Studio**, Jlaja aims to make travel planning seamless, fun, and personal.
